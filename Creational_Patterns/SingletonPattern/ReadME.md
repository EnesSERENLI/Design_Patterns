# Singleton

## A singleton is used to ensure that there is only one instance of an object and that the same (and only one instance) is called everywhere in your code whenever you need that object. In this way, when you develop an application that will be used by more than one person, instead of giving a private instance to each person, you will save the RAM from overloading by giving the same instance to everyone.
