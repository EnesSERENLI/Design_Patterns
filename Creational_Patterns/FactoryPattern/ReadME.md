# Factory Pattern

## The Factory Method is a type of creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in the superclass, but allows subclasses to change that type of object to be created. In other words, instead of getting an instance of the class you want to create, it enables the object to be produced over a single instance with the Factory Method.
